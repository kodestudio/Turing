# Turing
## A completely new programming language which has multi-purpose and suitable for developers.
### 1. What is Turing?
* Turing is an open-source project made by the Hydro OS team, with the support from Kode organization to tribute **Alan Turing**.

</p>

* This programming language is based on Free Pascal, GNU Pascal and KodePas Compiler.
* This project **is not** a customization of Pascal, we build Turing from **Scratch** with the support of **Pascal's Compiler**.
* Our team use ***Pascal's Compiler*** to compile our code into machine code for **excuting as program** in computer.
* We hope this language will help to reduce the development process and easily to maintain or refractor code.

* Turing language aims to:
  * **Easy-to-use-and-learn** syntax.
  * **Fast** compiling.
  * **Debug** friendly with users.
  * **Multi-purposed** usage for making application, website, AI and more,...
  * **Friendly community** and helpful forums.

### 2. Our targets
  - [ ] Build concept for our programming language.
  - [ ] Build context-grammar-tree.
  - [ ] Build lexer, parser, compiler
  - [ ] Build framework for making app, web, AI,...
  - [ ] Write documentation and start beta-testing.
